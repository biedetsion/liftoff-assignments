### Overview
WorkoutCentral is an app designed to be a one stop shop for a user's gym needs. I recently started working out
and I found it difficult to figure out which gym I wanted to attend. Users should be able to find their favorite gym
with favorite attributes. Also once a chosen gym is sorted out the user's journey is just getting started. I would like 
a user can hash out which are their favorite workouts and when they would like to use them. I have an Apple Watch and
I appreciate it's features of tracking my workouts. What I've found is that I don't have an organized way to map out
which workouts I would like to perform or to keep track of which ones I want to continue using. I feel like an app
to organize this would greatly benefit myself and users as well.
